# A Gauss Jordan Solver Python
python code that reduces 3x3 matrices to RREF and gives the solution to the system of equations.
  Input A and v, and the code will output the solution, the x vector.
## Example Input
A:

        2      -1      0

        1      3      -1

        0      1       2

v:

      -1

       5

       5

Output x:

       0.5

        2

       1.5

Which is the correct solution.
